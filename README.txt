This is an extension for the Chrome browser that allows the display of the status
of the NSO GONG H-Alpha stations.

To use it :

 * Open Chrome
 * In the menu, select "More tools" and then "Extensions"
 * Turn on "Developer mode" (top right)
 * Select "Load unpacked", then in the selection box, navigate to this directory.
   The extension should load.
 * You can also "pin" the extension using the (tiny) extension icon (which I think
   is supposed to be a puzzle piece, indicating a plugin) which means it will stay around.
